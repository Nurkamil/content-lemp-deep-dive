# content-lemp-deep-dive/NGINX

## This directory contains configuration files, code and other collateral from the LEMP Stack Deep Dive course on Linux Academy

### Lab Directories

***There are directories for 7/9 of the labs in the course.  Two of the labs don't have NGINX configurations.***

In each directory, you will find two directories:

html : This directory contains the contents of the 'html' directory (either `/var/www/html` or `/usr/share/nginx/html`) for each lab

nginx : This is the `/etc/nginx` directory from each lab and contains all the NGINX configuration information

The lessons were recorded using the lab environments, and the lab environments contain the configuration for both the lesson environment (testdomain.local) as well as the lab environment (bigstatecollege.edu).
